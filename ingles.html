            <p>My name is Arthur Mendonça Rodrigues, I'm 17 years old, I live in Santa Albertina / SP and I'm studying Systems of Internet at FATEC Jales. I have worked as an office assistant in the city police station and am unemployed at the moment.</p>
            <p>Ever since little enough interest in technology area, but never went behind me to delve into. During high school, several things went through my mind about choosing course, I already thought about Law, Biology and even gave a contest for the Military Police, but without a doubt, a better choice to carry out the vestibular service Of FATEC and get to know this incredible and extensive world of programming.</p>
